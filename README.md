## Data Mining ðŸ“Š

**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, standardization, correlation matrix analysis, identifying significant variables, feature importance, and modeling.

**Modeling Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
###### (If you are interested in other projects on Modelisation, I suggest taking a look at this project. [Modelisation](https://github.com/CatelloTheDataProjectManager/Predicting-Energy-Consumption/blob/main/README.md))

**Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve.

**Analysis**: Binary classification, multivariate classification, regression with best parameters (k-NN classifier, Decision Tree, Voting Classifier, RandomForest), evaluation (classification_report).

**Data Cleaning**: Tokenize using tweet tokenizer, spelling corrections, representing tweets as vectors (TF-IDF) & word cloud.

**Data Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RandomForest.

**Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, Receiver Operating Characteristic.

**Optimization**: Weighted Logistic Regression or Cost Sensitive Logistic Regression, regularization and hyperparameter tuning.
