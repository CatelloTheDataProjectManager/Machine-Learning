# Machine Learning ðŸ¤–

In real life, I was led to create and generate revenue forecasts through modeling. Additionally, I analyzed sentiments and recurring themes in messages between customers and customer service representatives.

## Data Mining ðŸ“Š

**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding, standardization, correlation matrix analysis, identifying significant variables, feature importance, and modeling.

**Modeling Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.

**Data Cleaning**: Tokenize using tweet tokenizer, spelling corrections, representing tweets as vectors (TF-IDF) & word cloud.

**Data Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, RandomForest.

**Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, Receiver Operating Characteristic.

**Optimization**: Weighted Logistic Regression or Cost Sensitive Logistic Regression, regularization and hyperparameter tuning.

All the Natural Language Processing (NLP) treatments presented in this repository were conducted using Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly. SageMaker offers a robust environment for scalable and efficient NLP model development, making it an ideal choice for handling large datasets and complex models.

For more detailed insights into my work with Large Language Models (LLM) and NLP using Amazon SageMaker, I invite you to explore my dedicated project:
